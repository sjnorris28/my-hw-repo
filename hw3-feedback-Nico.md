**Overall**  
Great work on this assignment! You effectively built the models, and interpreted all outputs. What I recommend is that you take this analysis/model, and try your hand using sklearn! Maybe even try out some different types of models we have learned: KNN, Decision trees, random forest, boosted trees, naive bayes, or SVMs! Try out some different techniques that we learned, and used, in our kaggle competition. Otherwise, not much else to say.
