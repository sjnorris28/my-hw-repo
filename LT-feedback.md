***Project 1: NYT***  
This is a great project to try your hand at some webscraping and working with online data. However, you may want to try and define the scope of your project, the outcome, a bit more explicitly. You could take in a ton of this data and then model, say, shares, likes, # of comments, or some other metric that indicates viewership success, virality of content, or something of the sort. As you mentioned, this fairly challenging to do without internal data, but you could derive your own metric!   


***Project 2: StubHub***  
This is an awesome project, and there are bunch of helpful resources. I also be that Haskie can help a ton on this one. I will say, though, this is a bit more of a programming project/exercise, and less of a modeling project. You won't have much opportunity to model anything unless you change the outcome/scope of your project. Again, what is the question you want to answer?


***Project 3: Housing***  
This is perfect. Not much to say!
