Awesome project! This is a good start, and a great dataset to work from.

***Making it ML***  
There are many ways that you can make this a modeling type project. The model you make, and the approach you will take, depends fundamentally on what question you would like to answer. If, for example, the outcome is to find out if a home is over or under priced, then maybe you build a model to predict price and then you cluster (or have a hard set rule) based on price and location to find out if a homes fall into some underlying groups or have some structure. From there, you could look into them and label those as "move here" or "don't move here". Or you can just build a model on price and then start just grouping them but price-per-city. Or you can label it yourself (which is tedious, but you could do it). Or you could develop some criteria for what would lead you to move to a place or not, then build a classification model on top of that.

There are tons of ways you can structure this problem and approach it, but what you should start with is what _exactly_ is the question that you would like to answer. Then, you should move from there!

***Data size***  
I haven't seen the data, but you should be fine. If it does get too large, or you would simply like a challenge/to learn something new, you could host it on a server in AWS and get a ton more processing power!

Let's talk about where you think the project is headed and we can get you on your way.
